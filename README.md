Biochemist turned bioinformatician. I work with metagenomics and microbiomes. My key interest is to move from correlations between microbiomes and health to causative effect. I do this by incorporating the latest knowledge in microbiology with the newest sequencing technology and novel informatics approaches.
I am currently working on analyzing human gut metagenomic samples to find causal links between bacteria and the development of childhood asthma. I have developed and documented the metagenomic workflow from raw sequencing reads to both read-based analysis and metagenome-assembled genomes. I have also been responsible for the analysis of metagenomes from animals, soils, plants and aquatic systems giving me an in-depth understanding of their different challenges and solutions.
